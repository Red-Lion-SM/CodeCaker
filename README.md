# Code Editor for Competitive Programmers üë®‚Äçüíª
It is a C++/Python Code editor which can be very helpful for Competitive Programmers due its amazing features.

It Parses Input and Output from Codeforces website by providing contest ID and problem ID so that user will not have to spend time in manually copying inputs and comparing outputs, everything is done on single click. I implemented this part using ***Beautiful Soup*** and ***Requests*** in Python.

On single click it compile and run the code, which will take input from parsed data, and also give verdict of correct or wrong answer by comparing it to the parsed output. Here I used linux ***os.system*** calls.

Color different parts of code with diffrent colors to make better experience, this part is also implemented using ***Python Tags*** and ***Search function***.
